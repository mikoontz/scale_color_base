# scale_color_base
Map a custom color palette to a vector of values in R

This function uses base R functions to conveniently map a custom color palette to a vector of values. The function returns a character vector (the same length as the input vector of values) with hex strings representing a color. This vector is suitable for passing to the col= argument in a plot() function call.
